# Import Imaris Tracks

The matlab script imports the paths of tracked spots created with Imaris (bitplane) into matlab, in a form that is expected by the msdanalyzer (https://tinevez.github.io/msdanalyzer/).
Open exported file in matlab, change the name of the table at the beginning of the script to correspond to table of the opened file and run the script.
